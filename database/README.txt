In phpMyAdmin (or whatever database management tool you're using):

Create a new database called "food_coop_db" and import the "food_coop_db.sql" file.

This version of the database contains two anonymous users:

Email: admin@admin.com, Password: password
Email: producer@producer.com, Password: password

The email addresses and passwords can be changed by logging in to the website (foodcoop/shop/index.php) and clicking "Update Contact Details".

An example product list is included for the anonymous producer.

Only the anonymous admin can log in to the admin area of the website (foodcoop/shop/admin/index.php), where new order cycles can be configured, new collection locations added, etc..  An example order cycle and example collection locations are included in the database.
